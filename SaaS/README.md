This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```bash
# Supabase credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

2. Create a Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) if you haven't already.
3. Get your project URL and anon key from the Supabase dashboard API settings.
4. Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your actual credentials.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Authentication

This application uses Supabase for authentication. The following methods are supported:
- Email/password login
- Social logins (Google, GitHub)

When users sign up, their information is automatically stored in Supabase Auth. You don't need to manually create tables for this as Supabase handles it automatically.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
